The Cleanse Co-Innovation Lab - CLoud nativE ApplicatioN SEcurity -  is a joint investment between [Deda](https://www.deda.group/deda/innovazione/co-innovation-lab) and FBK for the sharing of its promoters' strong competencies, with the aim of enabling the market to integrate new methodologies and new tools for the development of secure-by-design cloud-native software, so as to anticipate and respond to the increasingly high standards required in the field of cybersecurity — linked for example to the new NIS2 regulation — and to the complexity of the challenges posed by new technology and application scenarios.
