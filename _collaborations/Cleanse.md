The Cleanse Co-Innovation Lab - CLoud nativE ApplicatioN SEcurity - is a joint investment between [Dedagroup](https://www.deda.com/gruppo/corporate-governance/technology-innovation) and FBK for the sharing of its promoters’ strong competencies, with the aim to anticipate the emerging security requirements of cloud-native software systems built from modular, distributed components that continuously interact with each other and with external modules to organizations. Needs that will also become increasingly pressing as a result of new technologies, such as AI, and regulatory obligations, such as NIS2 or EU AI Act. 

The lab will be concerned not only with developing methodologies and application solutions for security by design, but also with building those layers of security that will bridge the gaps that still exist in this area, and which are due to the distributed nature of native cloud software and external to the corporate perimeter in the case of public cloud use. 
Cleanse’s main objectives and areas of activity include:
- DevSecOps & Secure Coding: defining software development processes that integrate security into the DevOps lifecycle, and providing tools for secure coding, automated vulnerability detection, and continuous compliance with security standards.
- Digital Identity and Distributed Service Security: leveraging expertise from FBK’s Cybersecurity Center to develop solutions for identity, access management, and security in distributed cloud architectures, ensuring trust and reliability in digital interactions.
- AI Enhanced Security: exploring the use of AI techniques to strengthen security—such as intelligent anomaly detection and AI based automated code verification—while ensuring that the AI components themselves remain secure and trustworthy.
- Continuous Technology Transfer: Cleanse acts as a constant bridge between advanced research and industrial practice, with a specific focus on security.

Cleanse operates with a joint FBK–Dedagroup team, where cybersecurity researchers from FBK work alongside Dedagroup software engineers who bring deep understanding of customer needs and constraints in critical sectors.
The lab positions itself as a frontier environment for security by design: a strategic investment that allows Dedagroup to experiment with and adopt new security solutions early in its products—ensuring high and up to date security standards for clients—while providing FBK with a real world testing environment to validate research and generate tangible impact, contributing to a more secure and trustworthy digital ecosystem.
