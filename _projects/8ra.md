The [8ra Initiative](https://www.8ra.com/) is a strategic European endeavour dedicated to create a resilient and scalable digital infrastructure tailored to Europe’s needs.

At its core is the [Important Project of Common European Interest on Next Generation Cloud Infrastructure and Services (IPCEI-CIS)](https://commission.europa.eu/projects/ipcei-next-generation-cloud-infrastructure-and-services-ipcei-cis-secunet-secunetedgecloud-essen_en), bringing together 12 EU member states and about 120 industrial and research partners to drive Europe’s digital sovereignty. The main goal of IPCEI-CIS is to establish a "Multi-Provider Cloud-Edge Continuum" that operates independently of any single provider. This continuum embodies the seamless fusion of cloud and edge computing, enabling the flexible allocation of resources and applications between the cloud and the network edge.

In 8RA, FBK is responsible for the project [Cybersecurity & AI at the Edge (CAITE)](https://ipcei-cis.fbk.eu/) whose aim is twofold. First, it aims to bring AI at the edge, by providing scalability and resource efficiency through the development of cooperative, distributed AI algorithms, optimising data, energy, and processing resources while adapting to the different computational environments and capabilities. Second, the project emphasises the creation of security, privacy-enhancing, and trust-aware services to ensure resilience and compliance in distributed AI-enabled applications.

Three research centers of FBK cooperate and develop CAITE: the [Augmented Intelligence Center](https://augmentedintelligence.fbk.eu/), the [Center for Cybersecurity](https://cs.fbk.eu/), and the [Digital Society Center](https://digis.fbk.eu/).
