      There is a strong interest in privacy-enhancing technologies to satisfy the complex requirements of digital identity, in particular minimizing the personal data shared at each presentation and preventing others from correlating the activity of digital identity credential holders between presentations. Important use cases are the Mobile Driver's License (ISO 18013-5) and the European Digital Identity Wallet.
      Cryptographic accumulators, e.g., [BdM93, N05, LLX07, BBF18, VB20] are efficient protocols to prove set (non-)membership that have been proposed as privacy-enhancing credential revocation mechanisms for digital credentials, e.g., [CL02].
      During the internship, you will have an opportunity to consider theoretical and practical aspects of these technologies, to be agreed upon based on your interest and prior knowledge. We are particularly interested in a performance comparison of algorithms of interest, possibly using existing libraries (e.g., accumulator-rs).

      Electronic voting (e-voting) includes processes in whole or in part executed by electronic means, such as by using voting machines to cast ballots, using scanners to digitize paper ballots, or casting votes remotely over the internet (i-voting).
      Cryptography is at the heart of end-to-end verifiable protocols, including additively homomorphic encryption to tally votes without decrypting each one, secure multi-party computation to avoid a single authority from having all private keys, and zero-knowledge proofs to prove ballot correctness, among other properties.
      During a recent e-voting project, we developed a library for cryptographic functions in Python based on the MIRACL core library and the protocol summarized in [LMST22]. The successful applicant will have the opportunity to assist in performing the same task in the more secure and performant Rust language.

      Safeguarding private keys presents many issues, especially for the general public. Private keys can be easily lost or forgotten, leading to the inaccessibility of the assets which they control.
      On the other hand, delegating full control of the keys to a third party for safekeeping is risky and may not be viable.
      We would like to implement and test a recently proposed cryptographic key recovery scheme [BLM22] based on a distributed secret sharing that allows some parties to be offline during the key-generation process.

      Given the limited trust and inherently centralized nature of Cloud-based applications, the blockchain emerges as the ideal solution to guarantee the integrity and the confidentiality of sensitive data in cross-organizational scenarios. However, the basic security properties offered by the blockchain should be coupled with fine-grained access control policies (e.g., role- and attribute-based access control) enforced through cryptography (e.g., hybrid cryptography, multi-authority attribute-based encryption) for best security. The main goal of this project is to investigate how cryptographic access control is and can be used in blockchain-based applications to enforce access control policies in complex cross-organizational scenarios.

      Workflows represent a series of activities that need to be executed in a specific order to achieve a certain goal. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the standard most widely adopted by organizations to model business processes as workflows. Within this context, the FBK's Center for Cybersecurity developed a methodology for deriving role-based access control policies from BPMN workflows automatically based on their syntax and that of BPMN symbols [1, 2]. The main goal of this project revolves around the implementation of the aforementioned methodology in a programming language of choice (e.g., Python, Kotlin, Rust). The project then seeks to enhance the capabilities of the aforementioned methodology to include the specification of constraints such as (dynamic and static) separation of duty. Finally — according to the time available — the project aims to investigate the relationship between the access control policies derived from BPMN workflows and the concepts of policy resiliency, workflow satisfiability, and policy change impact analysis.

      Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is often employed to protect the confidentiality of Cloud-hosted sensitive data from both external attackers and curious service providers while enforcing access control policies. In CAC, the sensitive data is encrypted, and the permission to access the encrypted data is embodied by the (secret) decrypting key. Unfortunately, CAC usually incurs significant computational overhead — mainly due to cryptographic computations — that limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, by itself, CAC does not provide suitable abstractions for specifying additional information and constraints (e.g., on how much a user is trusted) that may instead be useful to relieve such a computational overhead. Put in the context of an already ongoing collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, the main goal of this project is to enhance CAC by investigating one or more of the following ideas: 
      <ol>
        <li><b>Logic Predicates</b>: express assumptions and requirements about users and resources;</li>
        <li><b>Negative Permissions</b>: deny accesses explicitly through a careful distribution of cryptographic keys;</li>
        <li><b>Improved Performance</b>: investigate other means (e.g., use of symmetric vs. asymmetric cryptography) to directly relieve the computational overhead of CAC.</li>

      Microservices are the basic building blocks for modern Cloud-native applications. However, the orchestration — and especially the placement — of microservices should be aware of the functional and security requirements of the underlying applications. The main goal of this project revolves around the design of a methodology and a toolset for orchestrating (microservices in) Cloud-native applications to balance the minimization of risks due to the possible presence of security threats (e.g., malicious insider attackers, curious tenants) and the achievement of service performance requirements (e.g., expressed on computational resources, network throughput and latency).

    title: Cryptographic Unlinkability in Digital Identity Protection

    description: >
      Studying unlinkability in the world of digital identity holds significant importance. It helps create strong and privacy-preserving digital identity systems, allowing people to protect their privacy by preventing others from linking their actions and building profiles. A good example use case of this study is the European Digital Identity Wallet, which stores information such as IDs and mobile driving licenses.
      Cryptographic techniques such as selective disclosure and zero-knowledge mechanisms [1, 2, 3] can ensure that digital identity systems provide only the necessary information, contributing to the unlikability of identity credentials and user privacy in regards. However, it's imperative to question the reliability of these techniques.
      Machine learning, with its proficiency in pattern recognition and data analysis, is a powerful tool in this context. It possesses the capability to uncover hidden links and vulnerabilities within these systems, enabling the detection and mitigation of re-identification and profiling [4]. 
      During your internship, you will get a chance to explore both the theory and practical aspects of these techniques, based on your interests and prior knowledge. Our specific focus centers on investigating the key factors that contribute to the unlinkability of identity credentials, with a special emphasis on the implementation of unlinkability techniques in their creation and presentation within the relevant use case. We will also use machine learning to see how any of these key factors, i.e., credential's info (attribute, metadata, ...) can make it easier or harder to stay anonymous.

      Kubernetes is the facto container orchestrator in public and private clouds. It presents many features that facilitate the management not only of containers but also several elements that help implement more complex applications, like secrets, configmaps, services, and ingresses. All the configurations are handled through an API that manages the access using an RBAC system. These requests to the API are logged by the auditing module, which can be configured with different granularity. If a User or Service Account is compromised, some malicious actor can execute commands to obtain confidential information, like passwords or application topologies. Given the substantial volume of logged events, threshold-based or string-pattern matching algorithms can not be enough to identify malicious behavior in the cluster. So, this project aims to explore the state-of-the-art and compare existing anomaly detection algorithms and their applicability to auditing logs.

      Containers have arisen as a lightweight alternative to virtual machines (VMs).  While they have become the industry standard for deploying microservices, container security remains the foremost concern and a significant obstacle to adoption for numerous companies.
      Containers, as bundles of applications and services packaged together, are susceptible to software bugs or to the inclusion of malware, whether intentionally or inadvertently. These anomalous programs possess the same capabilities as any other component within the container image, making them potential threats to other containers or hosts within the ecosystem.
      The goal of this project is to investigate Machine Learning (ML) methods to detect container anomalies through the analysis of their systems calls, i.e., of their interactions with the kernel of the hosting machine.

      A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) serves as the initial line of defence against network attacks that threaten the integrity of data, systems, and networks. Over recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been increasingly used in NIDSs to detect malicious traffic due to their remarkable accuracy in identifying malicious network activity. Nonetheless, DNNs exhibit susceptibility to Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks, where subtle alterations to input data can lead to misclassification by the neural network. This vulnerability has particularly severe consequences, as adversarial attacks pose a substantial threat to overall network security.
      While the majority of current research in the field of AML has been directed towards computer vision tasks like image classification and object recognition, there has been a notable increase in interest and activity within the cybersecurity domain. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in this domain, encompassing both performance-related issues and the practicality of applying these methods to real-world scenarios. 
      The primary objective of this project is to explore innovative and practical methodologies aimed at enhancing the resilience of NIDSs against AML attacks.

      eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a recent development in the Linux kernel that allows users to programmatically monitor, observe, and manage kernel activity in a safe and extensible way [1]. In the past years, research has flourished on the topic, with solutions being developed ranging from system call monitoring to container observability, network management and more [2, 3].  However, while moving monitoring solutions to the kernelspace has inherent security and speed advantages, often the overhead of the monitoring activity itself is disregarded.
      The project will begin by learning about eBPF, its capabilities, and how to understand and write eBPF code. The final objectives of this project are twofold. First, candidates will evaluate the state-of-the-art literature, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of several observability solutions and quantitatively analyzing the overhead on the system resources (e.g., CPU, memory).  Second, candidates will focus on decreasing resource usage in these solutions; examples may include upgrades of the kernel version, better selection of observed features, and more.

      In recent years, more and more online services are being exposed over the Internet to enable a seamless experience for the citizens (e.g., eHealth, eGovernment and home banking platforms). Depending on their level of sensibility, these services may require a strong authentication of the claimants, in order to have guarantees on their (digital) identity. Authentication protocols thus represent a significant target for malicious entities, who frequently try to compromise them to illegitimately access the underlying services and gain advantages. For this reason, evaluating the security of Identity Management protocols represents a fundamental task, as it allows to identify potential attackers and define countermeasures to mitigate them. Among the techniques that are commonly used in this field, formal methods represent the most precise, yet computationally complex: they usually require a formal specification of the protocol under the evaluation, and verify that the security properties to guarantee hold during the execution of the protocol.<br />
      The state of the art currently features many tools to perform security protocol verification, each one with its own peculiarities. Within the Security & Trust research unit, we are currently using the tool SATMC [1]; however, we would like to explore other tools (e.g., Tamarin [2], ProVerif [3], VerifPal [4]) in order to understand similarities and differences, as well as face challenges related to how the gap with SATMC can be filled.

      Workflows represent a series of activities that need to be executed in a specific order to achieve a certain goal. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the standard most widely adopted by organizations to model business processes as workflows. Within this context, the FBK's Center for Cybersecurity developed a methodology for deriving role-based access control policies from BPMN workflows automatically based on their syntax and that of BPMN symbols [1, 2]. The main goal of this project revolves around the implementation of the aforementioned methodology in a programming language of choice (e.g., Python, Kotlin, Rust). The project then seeks to enhance the capabilities of the aforementioned methodology to include the specification of constraints such as (dynamic and static) separation of duty. Finally — according to the time available — the project aims to investigate the relationship between the access control policies derived from BPMN workflows and the concepts of policy resiliency, workflow satisfiability, and policy change impact analysis.

      Given the limited trust and inherently centralized nature of Cloud-based applications, the blockchain emerges as the ideal solution to guarantee the integrity and the confidentiality of sensitive data in cross-organizational scenarios. However, the basic security properties offered by the blockchain should be coupled with fine-grained access control policies (e.g., role- and attribute-based access control) enforced through cryptography (e.g., hybrid cryptography, multi-authority attribute-based encryption) for best security. The main goal of this project is to investigate how cryptographic access control is and can be used in blockchain-based applications to enforce access control policies in complex cross-organizational scenarios.

      There is a strong interest in privacy-enhancing technologies to satisfy the complex requirements of digital identity, in particular minimizing the personal data shared at each presentation and preventing others from correlating the activity of digital identity credential holders between presentations. Important use cases are the Mobile Driver's License (ISO 18013-5) and the European Digital Identity Wallet.<br />
      Cryptographic accumulators, e.g., [BdM93, N05, LLX07, BBF18, VB20] are efficient protocols to prove set (non-)membership that have been proposed as privacy-enhancing credential revocation mechanisms for digital credentials, e.g., [CL02].<br />
      During the internship, you will have an opportunity to consider theoretical and practical aspects of these technologies, to be agreed upon based on your interest and prior knowledge. We are particularly interested in a performance comparison of algorithms of interest, possibly using existing libraries (e.g., accumulator-rs).

      Safeguarding private keys presents many issues, especially for the general public. Private keys can be easily lost or forgotten, leading to the inaccessibility of the assets which they control.
      On the other hand, delegating full control of the keys to a third party for safekeeping is risky and may not be viable.
      We would like to implement and test a recently proposed cryptographic key recovery scheme [BLM22] based on a distributed secret sharing that allows some parties to be offline during the key-generation process.

    description: >
      Studying unlinkability in the world of digital identity holds significant importance. It helps create strong and privacy-preserving digital identity systems, allowing people to protect their privacy, by preventing others from linking their actions and building profiles. A good example use case of this study is the European Digital Identity Wallet, which stores information such as IDs and mobile driving licenses.<br />
      Cryptographic techniques such as selective disclosure and zero-knowledge mechanisms [1,2,3] can ensure that digital identity systems provide only the necessary information, contributing to unlikability of identity credentials and user privacy in regards.  However, it's imperative to question the reliability of these techniques.<br />
      Machine learning, with its proficiency in pattern recognition and data analysis, is  a powerful tool in this context. It possesses the capability to uncover hidden links and vulnerabilities within identity systems, enabling the detection and mitigation of re-identification and profiling [4]. During your internship, you'll get a chance to explore both the theory and practical aspects of these techniques, based on your interests and prior knowledge. Our primary focus will be on investigating the key factors that contribute to the unlinkability of identity credentials, with a special emphasis on the implementation of unlinkability techniques, particularly in the context of identity creation and presentation within relevant use cases. We'll also use machine learning to see how any of these key factors can make it easier or harder to stay anonymous.

      Revocation of X.509 certificates on the web is commonly addressed by Certificate Revocation Lists [CRL] and Online Certificate Status Protocol [OCSP]. The most common scenario is one in which the certificate Holder is a web server, the certificate Verifier is a desktop-run web browser, and the revocation Responder is also a web server. Scalability of this model to large numbers of Verifiers may be handled by content delivery networks.<br />
      New scenarios of interest are emerging, including the Mobile Driving License [ISO18013-5], in which both Holder and Verifier may be edge devices, either or both of which may be offline for significant periods of time, and both have fewer resources than the web-based client-server scenario. New mechanisms are also being considered, e.g. [JCSL], as well as cryptographic revocation. It is not obvious in all possible scenarios what the best balance would be between frequency of revocation status requests, frequency of issuance (signature) of attestations and revocation information, and bandwidth consumed, given the different options available for implementing technologies, while at the same time guaranteeing the greatest degree of security and privacy for all participants.<br />

      Electronic voting (e-voting) includes processes in whole or in part executed by electronic means, such as by using voting machines to cast ballots, using scanners to digitize paper ballots, or casting votes remotely over the internet (i-voting).<br />
      Cryptography is at the heart of end-to-end verifiable protocols, including additively homomorphic encryption to tally votes without decrypting each one, secure multi-party computation to avoid a single authority from having all private keys, and zero-knowledge proofs to prove ballot correctness, among other properties.<br />
      During a recent e-voting project, we developed a library for cryptographic functions in Python based on the MIRACL core library and the protocol summarized in [LMST22]. The successful applicant will have the opportunity to assist in performing the same task in the more secure and performant Rust language.

      DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) is an approach to automate the integration of cybersecurity processes at every phase of the software development lifecycle, from initial design through integration, testing, deployment, and software delivery. It represents a natural and necessary evolution in the way development organizations approach security.<br />
      For Cloud Native Applications, security regards multiple levels (code, container, deployment, orchestrator, etc.) and the approach to introduce security should consider all of them.

      Kubernetes Without Kubelet (KWOK) [1][2] is an experimental tool that is able to simulate large Kubernetes clusters with a very limited footprint on the system. While setting up regular Kubernetes clusters --- even for testing and educational purposes --- requires time, resources and even an innocent mistake may require a full redeployment, KWOK allows the provisioning of multiple clusters, each with hundreds of nodes, with no overhead and full compatibility with all the Kubernetes ecosystem. Workloads that are deployed will be transparently simulated on the system, reflecting any configuration provided by users (redundancy, quotas, labels) and reacting accordingly, just like a real cluster.<br />
      The objective of this internship project is twofold. First, candidates will get acquainted with container orchestration and how to the Kubernetes works, the interactions between all the modules, and the configuratgions needed to run custom schedulers, CRDs, proxies and tools. Second, the candidate will learn more about CRDs and custom projects using K8s, testing in the KWOK a custom scheduler.

      A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) serves as the initial line of defence against network attacks that threaten the integrity of data, systems, and networks. Over recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been increasingly used in NIDSs to detect malicious traffic due to their remarkable accuracy in identifying malicious network activity. Nonetheless, DNNs exhibit susceptibility to Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks, where subtle alterations to input data can lead to misclassification by the neural network. This vulnerability has particularly severe consequences, as adversarial attacks pose a substantial threat to overall network security. While the majority of current research in the field of AML has been directed towards computer vision tasks like image classification and object recognition, there has been a notable increase in interest and activity within the cybersecurity domain. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in this domain, encompassing both performance-related issues and the practicality of applying these methods to real-world scenarios. The primary objective of this project is to explore innovative and practical methodologies aimed at enhancing the resilience of NIDSs against AML attacks.

      Identity Management (IdM) protocols are the protocols supporting Single-Sign On (SSO) which is an authentication schema allowing the user to access different services using the same set of credentials. Two of the most known IdM protocols are SAML 2.0 SSO and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect. Several solutions for corporations like Google, Meta (Facebook) and for Public Administration like eIDAS and SPID are based on IdM protocols. We propose improving the tool to extend its capabilities by designing and implementing new features.

    title: Automated Privacy Posture Assessment of OpenID Connect Solutions

      OpenID Connect (OIDC) has shown to need a set of privacy best current practices (BCPs), since only a handful of guidelines can be found in this regard. In 2023, we provided a set of BCPs to fill that gap (Sassetti et al.), as well as an assessment of the privacy posture of several OIDC Providers (OPs). The results have shown that only a few OPs provide high baseline privacy, whereas many others implement only bare minimum requirements. Though, one of the issues of the analysis was the lack of automation, thus impacting its scale.<br />
      As a new line of work, we plan on automating the assessment of the privacy posture of OPs and extending it to web applications that are integrating the solutions of identified OPs. This can be done either by using pentesting tools, i.e., Micro-Id-Gym (MIG) (Bisegna et al.), or with autonomously developed scripts; a third hybrid approach can be considered.

      - Knowledge of the OpenID Connect protocol is a plus (soft-requirement).
      - Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
    objectives: >
      The main objectives of this internship project are as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Extend the analysis of OPs by designing a way to automate the testing of OPs (MIG or script) and confirming the previous results;</li>
        <li>Extend the analysis to a larger number of OPs, given the fact that the analysis is now automated;</li>
        <li>Extend the analysis of the privacy posture to web applications and test a large number of web applications.</li>
      </ul>
      The results would give us a better-defined picture of the privacy posture of the OIDC actors. We can derive a more accurate analysis of the OIDC environment; such results can be extremely relevant for both the industry and academia. This can additionally have impacts on real-world applications.

      "The characteristics of cloud native applications — like the inherent decentralization, the intricate threat model, and the presence of highly dynamic and interconnected microservices — bring forth a number of challenges to data security. In a recently published article [1], the Center for Cybersecurity (CS) of FBK has investigated the use of CryptoAC [2] to provide end-to-end protection of sensitive data in cloud native applications through cryptographic enforcement of access control policies. CryptoAC (short for Cryptographic Access Control) is an open-source tool written in the (multiplatform) Kotlin language, and potentially available as programming library, plugin, or microservice (Docker container). In this context, applicants may choose one of the following 2 activities: collaborate on extending the work in [1] by refining and evaluting the use of CryptoAC for data security in cloud native applications or extend the capabilities of CryptoAC in one or more of the following areas: user authentication with OpenID Connect and FIDO, integration of CryptoAC with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), cryptographic key management, strategies and tools for cryptographic bill of materials management. This project provides the opportunity to acquire the fundamentals of scientific research, investigate and explore cutting-edge and relevant research topics, and engage in software engineering and development while allowing applicants to design, propose, and implement their own ideas."

      "The purpose and intent of DevSecOps is to build on the mindset that everyone is responsible for security with the goal of safely distributing security decisions at speed and scale to those who hold the highest level of context without sacrificing the safety required," describes Shannon Lietz, co-author of the "DevSecOps Manifesto."<br />
      DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) is an approach to automate the integration of cybersecurity processes at every phase of the software development lifecycle, from initial design through integration, testing, deployment, and software delivery. It represents a natural and necessary evolution in the way development organizations approach security.<br />
      For Cloud Native Applications, security regards multiple levels (code, container, deployment, orchestrator, etc.) and the approach to introduce security should consider all of them.

      Identity Management (IdM) protocols are the protocols supporting Single-Sign On (SSO) which is an authentication schema allowing the user to access different services using the same set of credentials. Two of the most known IdM protocols are SAML 2.0 SSO and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect. Several solutions for corporations like Google, Meta (Facebook) and for Public Administration like eIDAS and SPID are based on IdM protocols. We propose improving the tool to extend its capabilities by designing and implementing new features.

      Discovering, managing, and reporting on cryptographic assets is a critical step for the transition to quantum-safe systems and applications [0]. 
      The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) [1] proposes a standard to represent Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM) [2], useful to describe cryptographic assets and their dependencies in a Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) context.
      A CBOM is useful to understand the assets, their dependencies and the compliance with regulations, and a key enabler of cryptographic agility to secure critical systems against quantum computing threats.

      Since its first version was published as an RFC in 1999, Transport Layer Security (TLS) has rapidly become the de facto standard for providing confidentiality and integrity to communications exchanged in an unsecured environment. While there exist multiple implementations (e.g., OpenSSL, GnuTLS, rusttls) that allow system administrators to easily deploy a webserver, there does not exist a practical way to verify their compliance with the RFCs they are based on.<br />
      To ensure that a TLS deployment is configured correctly, (inter)national cybersecurity agencies such as US’ NIST and Italian’s AgID/ACN periodically issue technical guidelines that describe a set of requirements able to mitigate known vulnerabilities and ensure an adequate security level. These guidelines presume that security issues are only due to an incorrect configuration while, in reality, problems may also arise from an incorrectly developed TLS libraries that generate messages which do not comply with the related RFCs.<br />
      The primary objective of this internship is to perform a technical review of the available software able to analyze raw network packets, validate their content and which structure is used by the protocol. The results will be employed in a process that aims to develop a new tool that can verify, analyze, and execute TLS connections. This tool will be used to assess the compliance of TLS libraries and related deployments.

      As modern systems become increasingly complex, ensuring their security, privacy and resilience requires more advanced approaches to threat modeling.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful enabler to automate, enhance, and refine manual security and privacy assessments. By leveraging AI-driven techniques, organizations can identify the threats, vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors and mitigations more efficiently and with higher accuracy. However, the trustworthiness of AI-based threat modeling solutions must also be ensured—both to validate their findings and to mitigate any risks introduced by the AI systems themselves. This internship focuses on developing and evaluating AI-powered methodologies for automated threat modeling in cutting-edge systems such as Digital Identity Wallet and e-voting.

      The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unlocked new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence across a wide range of fields, including privacy engineering. As modern applications increasingly handle sensitive user data, safeguarding privacy has become more critical than ever. To ensure robust data protection, potential threats must be identified and addressed early in the development process. Privacy threat modeling frameworks like LINDDUN offer structured approaches for uncovering these risks, yet they often require significant manual effort, expert knowledge, and detailed system information—making the process time-intensive and reliant on thorough analysis. To address these challenges, at Security and Trust unit of the Center for Cybersecurity, we introduced and developed PILLAR (Privacy risk Identification with LINDDUN and LLM Analysis Report), a new tool that implements and automates the LINDDUN framework through LLM integration to streamline and enhance privacy threat modeling. PILLAR automates key parts of the LINDDUN process, such as generating DFDs from unstructured textual inputs (e.g. system descriptions), eliciting privacy threats, and risk-based threat prioritization.<br />
      The primary objective of this internship is to conduct state-of-the-art research on privacy threat modeling, in particular, LLM-based approaches emphasizing how LLMs can be leveraged to automate and enhance these processes. The results will be employed to integrate AI agent concepts into PILLAR.
